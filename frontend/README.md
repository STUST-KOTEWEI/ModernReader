# ModernReader Frontend

This is the React + TypeScript frontend for ModernReader.

Quick start (requires Node.js >= 18):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Dev server:
- Runs on port 5176 by default (see `vite.config.ts`).

Design system:
- Lightweight components live in `src/design-system/`.
- Existing legacy components are under `src/components/DesignSystem/`.

Using components:
```tsx
import { Button, Card } from './src/design-system'

<Button>Click me</Button>
<Card title="Hello">This is a demo card.</Card>
```

API:
- Frontend expects backend proxied at `/api/v1/`.
- Services client is implemented in `src/services/api.ts` and uses axios.

Mock mode:
- If backend is unavailable, several components gracefully fallback to mocked data.

Notes:
- Tailwind is used across the app. If styles seem missing, ensure Tailwind is built (dev server does this).
- If you prefer Yarn or pnpm, feel free to switch; the scripts are standard.
